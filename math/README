Math example
------------

This example demonstrate a project that has 2 targets:

libmath: A library with math functions.
calculator: An execuatable that uses the libmath library.

Each of those has a CMakeLists.txt of its own, and there's a top-level CMakeLists.txt
which add_subdirectory's them both


PUBLIC | PRIVATE | INTERFACE
---------------------------
This example can also demonstarte the use of these modifiers 
in the context of the target_include_directories() of the libmath:
Notice that in order for the calculator project to compile, you have to 
set the target_include_directories() of libmath to PUBLIC - that way 
the directories you specify are also included in the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
of the calculator target. 
If you try setting it to PRIVATE - you'll get a compiler error.

The interesting thing is that setting it to INTERFACE also works, although it 
only populates the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES of libmath.
